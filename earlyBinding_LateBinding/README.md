First Point:
Method overriding depends on polymorphism at runtime. This behavior is called late binding.
However, static methods belong to the class, and the method to be executed is determined at compile time, which is called early binding.
Both cases are demonstrated in the code with proper explanations.

Second Point:
Early binding occurs at compile time, while late binding happens at runtime.

Third Point:
Static methods, final methods, private methods, and overloaded methods all use early binding and are resolved at compile time,
whereas instance methods use late binding and are resolved at runtim
